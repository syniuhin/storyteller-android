# Neural Storyteller for Android

Heavily impressed by the [neural-storyteller](https://github.com/ryankiros/neural-storyteller) project I wrote this very basic proof of the concept.

In particular, it proves that usual camera pictures are treated well by the model and prediction model latency is low enough for this application to be usable.
